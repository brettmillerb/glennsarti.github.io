### Blogging on paws

My family and I are moving from Portland back to Australia so unfortunately I'll be a bit busy.  That means I won't be able to do a blog post for a month or so.  Don't fret, I will be continuing the VSCode Puppet Extension Deep Dive!!  I already have Part 3 in draft but it will be a bit late.

Thanks for your patience and I'll see you soon.

Glenn.
