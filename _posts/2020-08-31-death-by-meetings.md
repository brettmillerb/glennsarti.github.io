# Meetings

MEETINGS! The very word sparks annoyance, on a good day, or hatred on a bad. We spend a lot of time in them and yet we feel they're pointless. But why? In DevOps we talk about autonomy and alignment and meetings _should_ be a time when we can do this.

I've worked in the local government and some large-ish private organisations and I've been had many hours wasted. Even during my time at [Puppet](https://puppet.com) which is an agile software company, meetings could still be horrible. So this is not just an issue of "Enterprises" being bad, it seems a more universal problem, not even confined to the technology sector.

[Steven Murawski](https://twitter.com/StevenMurawski) recommended I read many of the books by [Patrick Lencioni](https://www.tablegroup.com/pat/), now that I'm a newly minted consultant at [Telstra Purple](https://purple.telstra.com.au/). I've loved one of his previous books [Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.tablegroup.com/books/dysfunctions/). His writing style uses a fable, a story, which he weaves to describe the points he wants to make. This is not unlike the [Phoenix Project](https://itrevolution.com/book/the-phoenix-project/)

Patrick's book called [Death by Meeting](https://www.tablegroup.com/books/dbm/) talks about how to make meetings better.

> Death by Meeting focuses on a cure for the most painful yet underestimated problem of modern business: bad meetings.
>
> And what he suggests is both simple and revolutionary. Pat provides a framework for his groundbreaking model, and makes it applicable to the real world
