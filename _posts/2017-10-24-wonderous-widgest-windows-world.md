### [Wonderous Widgets in a Windows World](http://sched.co/C0Fz)

---

As DevOps culture permeates the Windows world, challenges arise. How can IT orgs integrate components of the toolchain in a sensible, iterative way while avoiding tool proliferation? We’ll look at example toolchains, how to chop-and-change tools in the chain, and explore what the future holds.

There has been a major movement in the Microsoft Windows world towards DevOps culture. DevOps practices and tools are not only being endorsed, but embraced and expanded. This has resulted in tool proliferation and questions over how to integrate components of the toolchain in a sensible, iterative way. How do we stitch tools together into pipelines and build our own DevOps toolchains? Where do we even start? If you’ve found yourself asking these questions, then this presentation is for you! We’ll walk through what example toolchains could look like, how we can chop-and-change tools in the chain, and what the future holds.
