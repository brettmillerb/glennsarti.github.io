I first started ballroom dancing, just over ten years ago with my then fiance, but now wife, Kim for our wedding.  One of my groomsmen, taught us the [Rhumba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhumba) for our wedding dance.  Since then I've learnt differnet styles but I found there were many lessons that could be applied to DevOps and team building.

Being a better leader through communication

-----
General Purpose: Inform/Persuade
Specific Purpose: After hearing this speech the audience will ...
be able be a better leader when partner dancing

Opening Hook:
I'm a dancer - For many years now, Ballroom and a Linear Salsa - it's a lot of fun, but quite scary too.  Take social dancing...

* describe the layout of the dance floor, song comes on, announces the dance tye and ask someone to be your partner for this dance

The partner could be any height, skill level, traffic, etc.  So many things that can go wrong!

and when you get the right partner it's magical...

I will talk about how to be a better leader in dancing through better communication

In partner dancing there's a leader and a follower. lead/follow is not dictatorial. it's a partnership.
And there is a conversation between them (to and fro of information between two people).
e.g. I am about to put into an underarm natural turn

The conversations requires a protocol for the communication.  We have that in the spoken and written language, and so to is the in the physical form.

IMO - Partner dancing is one the most graceful forms of non-verbal communication

5 points to help you be better leader through effective communicate

Supporting Points:
1 - Frame

Frame is how you position your body so that you both speak and listen to your partner, through touch

* Different dances require different frames: latin vs modern - Different dialects
Modern is closer, more connection points
Latin is more open - more hands

Much like your voice, your body frame must be strong enough to be heard, but flexible so you can hear your partner.

A weak frame (e.g.) gives mixed signals to the follower, making it hard for you to speak clearly to the follower
A hard frame (e.g.) means you can't hear when the follower is off balance, or in the wrong position to perform the next step

2. - Commitment

* move the whole body, not bits - equivalent to whispering, not talking.
Mixed signals if you move your legs but not your arms and vice versa.

3. - Listening

* The follower ALWAYS has the last word.  So it's important to listen to what they are saying.  They may be uncomfortable or forsee danger behind you.  Keep them safe!

* Adjust your leads and space on the followers conversation.  Trying complicated steps or not taking into account height differences makes the follower have a bad time.
Demonstrate hip difference?

4. - Tension

Contrary to your first instincts there must always be tension between the two parties.  You cannot see this on instruction videos or reality TV, it needs to be experienced.

Without tension you can only move in one direction, straight into a wall!

By applying tension through the frame, it magnifies like a megaphone.  So then only a small body movement is required to send a clear and obvious message.

5. - Other peoples shoes

You can quite literally walk/dance in someone elses shoes.  Take the opportunity to be a follower and FEEL what it's like to to be led.  Knowing how it feels to be spoken to, makes you a better speaker (much like toastmasters)

Conclusion

Follow these 5 tips and Treat your dance leading like you would speaking. and you soon have long list of people wanting to dance with you.
